### Dinic algoithm implementation in Go 

Main file `dinic.go` contains the `maxFlow` function that takes a graph and returns the maximum flow found using dinic algoithm. Tests are located in `dinic_test.go` file. In tests, `data/input/` directory is being recursively searched for files with `.in` extension. Each such file is being parsed and used as a test case. The corresponding file in the `data/output/` directory is being used as a reference output.
